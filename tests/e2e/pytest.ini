# E2E Testing Configuration - Isolated from pytest-homeassistant-custom-component
#
# This pytest.ini isolates e2e tests from the socket-blocking plugin used
# by integration tests. Run e2e tests with:
#   pytest tests/e2e/ -c tests/e2e/pytest.ini

# Disable plugins that interfere with Docker/testcontainers
# Note: plugin entry point is "homeassistant" (not "homeassistant-custom-component")

    -p no:homeassistant

# Test markers

    e2e: marks tests as end-to-end (requires Docker)
    synthetic_data: marks tests as requiring synthetic test data (Docker mode only)
    live_only: marks tests as requiring a live Home Assistant instance
